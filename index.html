    <h2>A Little History</h2>
    <p>Hello World!</p>
    <p>My name is Dean and quite frankly have dabbled in all things tech since high school - graduating 1996. 
        Now don't judge! üòâ. As I'm looking to focus on web design as a career so I can be home with my family. You see I travel
    for work. So instead of doing that, another way is to learn while I'm on the road. I have built websites and ecommerce on my own over 
    the last 15 years. However none from scratch, they've all been through drag drop builders. Ecommerce has been mainly Shopify. 
    January 2025, I started a <a href="https://microbite.farm/" target="_blank">vertical farm</a> at home that we use Shopify for, 
    recently having had to disable the ability for customers to purchase online since I have had to go back to work. They can still order through
    the form and my wife or kids step in and do the work. Planting, harvesting and deliveries. Are they not incredible! üëè</p>
    <p>Was going to post pictures, but in this moment I can't seem to figure that out. The svg i converted were super pixelated.</p>
