    <h2>A Little History</h2>
    <p>Hello World!</p>
    <p style="font-size:100px">My name is Dean and quite frankly have dabbled in all things tech since high school - graduating 1996. 
        Now don't judge! &#1F609;. As I'm looking to focus on web design as a career so I can be home with my family. You see I travel
    for work. I have built websites and ecommerce on my own over the last 15 years. However none from scratch, they've all been through drag
    drop builders. Ecommerce has been mainly Shopify. January 2025I started a <a href="microbite.farm">vertical farm</a> at home that we 
    use Shopify for, recently having had to disabled the ability for customers to purchase online since I have had to go back to work.</p>
