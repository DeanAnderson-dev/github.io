            <h2>Needing more customization?</h2>
            If your desire is for something more custom built to suit your personal touch,
            that can be easily discussed and setup. Nice thing about being freelance web developer is
            the number of people you meet and connect with. Honestly If we can't find a solution.
            I can connect you with someone who can do the work. With the option of being your voice
            and walking you through the process as the website comes to life.

        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>Focus time! It's taken most of my working career to see where I want to go. I started in 1996 writing COBOL. And
            have dabbled ever since in web design since then.
            Two things are going to be in focus, one is finding finding tools that will allow me to thrive in helping people
            in their businesses.
            Second will be to working diligantly on developing shopify projects on larger scale.
        <p>Neurodivergent individual with a high mechanical aptitude and excellent troubleshooting skills. Empathetic to the
            people I'm helping, with the goal of always building relationships and leaving a project better than I found it.</p>
        <p>I have a love and desire to keep learning and adding knowledge to my repertoire. Jack of many trades and an
            obsession with utilizing search engines and videos to figure things out.</p>
        <p>First and foremore I am a disciple of Jesus Christ. Saved by the power of grace through faith. He pulled me from
            the depths of hell and saved my soul.</p>
        <p>Homesteading dream and seeker of bare land.Teacher to my kids of hard work and not being afraid to work with our
            hands and getting dirty.</p>
